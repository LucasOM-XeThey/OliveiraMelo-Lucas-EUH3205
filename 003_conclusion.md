# Conclusion

## By Michael Gonzales [He/Him]

It is a given that the resulting singular nation-state of the German Empire established in 1871 could not have been forged without the prior periods of conflict and instability within the formerly independent German states. 
The unification of this empire would lead to reshaping domestic and foreign policies while stepping away from liberal economic policies, alongside friction with foreign powers that contributed to rising tensions in the following century that would culminate in two World Wars. [^1]
The symbolic significance of the unification ceremony itself was likewise vastly imperative, by deliberately selecting the Palace of Versailles as the venue for the ceremony instead of Berlin, Bismarck and the German Empire sent a powerful message. 
A message that illustrated a bold statement of militaristic might and conquest that would foreshadow the future endeavors of Germany into a dominant european nation through the first half of the 20th century that would result in clashes with many other european powers. [^2]
The core reason for these resulting tensions would be through the colonial expansion as a new superpower into areas of Asia, Pacific, and Africa in a period during which most European powers sought to divide and colonize vast parts of the African continent and Asian Pacific, leading the German Empire to come into direct aggressive competition with other nations such as Britain, France, Belgium, Italy, and Portugal. [^3]

Much of this was embraced in part to the new empire embracing imperialism and prestige hand in hand with its direct methods of colonization to elevate the status of Germany as a global power asserting its rights to various territories across the world. [^4] [^5]
Conclusively, the most important aspect of the unification of the German Empire was political shifts towards an authoritarian constitution and national parliament that would send ripples across all of Europe to directly bring about political polarizations and the rise of socialists leading to tension with conservative and liberal forces that would manifest in the early 20th century setting the stage for it’s collapse after World War I.
