# Analysis: Napoleonic Era

  The Napoleonic Wars and the era that followed were the first conflicts to reorganize the German states and prepare them for unification in the latter half of the nineteenth century. 
Lasting nearly nine years, the Napoleonic conflicts in the German states rearranged both the states’ legal systems and their physical borders. 
This overhaul of the states during the war paved the way for the development of German nationalism as well as the desire for the unification of the German states into one nation. 
Through the Napoleonic Wars in Germany, the lasting effects of the conflict, and the rise of nationalism after the end of the wars it is clear that the Napoleonic era in the German states was one of the first stepping stones to German unification.

  During the Napoleonic conflict, the German states began to show signs of nationalism and a desire for unification. 
Nationalism, used sparingly, was mostly used as a rallying point in the Franco-Prussian War of 1813 and the Wars of Independence afterward—and many states were reluctant to unify. 
There was also disharmony in the views of the German peoples during the French occupation of the states that was exemplified when Austria declared war against France in 1809. 
Austria claimed to act on behalf of all the German states, though there was no support behind their claim. 1
Nevertheless, there was a tentative unity through Napoleon’s development of the Confederation of the Rhine. 
Established in 1806, the Confederation started off with seventeen states, adding nineteen more by the year 1810. 2
The Confederation’s existence decreased the number of German states from hundreds to thirty-five as they were joined with either the Confederation or the four German states that were not a part of the Confederation. 
This pseudo-unification under French rule led to the adoption of the Napoleonic Code. 
Some states embraced the Code, but there were a number of nationalist groups that despised the idea of living according to the code of their conquerors. 3 
These nationalistic ideas became more common after the Franco-Prussian War in 1813, when King Frederick William III of Prussia “whipped up national feelings with a religious fervor” in order to liberate the “nation” and the “fatherland.” 4 
Ultimately, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end, culminating in the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815, but the end of the wars did not mean the end of the hope for unification nor the end of nationalism in the German states.

  The end Napoleonic occupation in the German states did not mean that the changes the wars had brought disappeared. 
While the Confederation of the Rhine may have dissolved in 1813, Napoleonic influence did not end there. 
In states annexed by Bavaria or Prussia after the war, they fought tooth and nail to keep the Napoleonic Code, kicking up such a fuss that both states eventually had to give into their demands. 5 
The Confederation of the Rhine, despite its dissolution, still had influence over the slow unification of the German states, starting with the German Confederation in 1815. 6
With members that included the original Confederation of the Rhine as well as the four that were not part of the original Confederation, the German Confederation was a result of the Congress of Vienna and its attempt to return the balance of power to Europe. 
Part of the Congress’s job was to restore prewar boundaries; however, when faced with the multitude of former German states, they created the thirty-nine states of the German Confederation instead. 7
The years after the Congress of Vienna found nationalism spreading throughout most of Europe, and the German states were no exception. 
However, while the goal of German nationalism was similar throughout the states, “a Germany unified upon the national principle,” there was no unified nationalistic movement among the states at this time. 8
Nevertheless, the rise of nationalism was becoming a concern for rulers such as Klemens von Metternich, who wished to preserve the power of absolute monarchies.

  In the aftermath of the Congress of Vienna, nationalism was on the rise throughout Europe and Germans began to call for the unification of the Confederation. 
As German nationalists became more vocal about their wish to unify, Metternich resolutely suppressed any and all resistance. 
He was of the opinion that “the threat of revolution in Germany was a malignant cancer,” and did everything he could to prevent rebellions from erupting in the Confederation. 9
Thus, in 1819, he managed to strongarm the Diet of the German Confederation into passing the Karlsbad Decrees. 
These Decrees censored the press, limited freedom of speech, and allowed the German Confederation to become the closest thing to a police state that it could be in the nineteenth century. 10
Despite the censorship, people still found ways to get their point across. 
For instance, a political cartoon from 1819 named The Thinkers Club critiqued the Decrees. 
Depicting a group of gagged German men sitting around a table, the caption says, “The most important question of today’s meeting: how long will Thinking be allowed to us?”[11] While this is clearly a bleak subject for Germans, this cartoon manages to successfully make its point, clearly hinting at Metternich’s determination to restrict the freedoms of German people without actually naming what it is that the cartoonist is trying to critique. 
Nevertheless, this cartoon exemplifies the way that Germans refused to be stopped by Metternich’s limitations in their quest for freedom while making a clear jab at the Karlsbad Decrees and their extensive restrictions. 
This determination carried over to the attempts at revolutions in the 1830s as well as in 1848. 
While these nationalistically driven events did not succeed in unifying Germany, they managed to set the stage for unification later in the century.

  The rise of nationalism during the French occupation of the German states as well as the desire for unification that came out of the Congress of Vienna were instrumental in preparing the German Confederation for the next steps in the process of unifying the German states. 
Nevertheless, there were obstacles such as the Karlsbad Decrees and Metternich’s ruthless suppression of anything that did not support absolute monarchies. 
Despite these challenges, however, German nationalism continued to persevere and so did the wish of many Germans to unify. 
Thus, the Napoleonic Wars and its consequences were able to successfully set the German states on the path to unification later in the nineteenth century.
