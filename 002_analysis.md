# Analysis: Napoleonic Era

The Napoleonic Wars and the era that followed were the first conflicts to reorganize the German states and prepare them for unification in the latter half of the nineteenth century. 
Lasting nearly nine years, the Napoleonic conflicts in the German states rearranged both the states’ legal systems and their physical borders. 
This overhaul of the states during the war paved the way for the development of German nationalism as well as the desire for the unification of the German states into one nation. 
Through the Napoleonic Wars in Germany, the lasting effects of the conflict, and the rise of nationalism after the end of the wars it is clear that the Napoleonic era in the German states was one of the first stepping stones to German unification.

During the Napoleonic conflict, the German states began to show signs of nationalism and a desire for unification. 
Nationalism, used sparingly, was mostly used as a rallying point in the Franco-Prussian War of 1813 and the Wars of Independence afterward—and many states were reluctant to unify. 
There was also disharmony in the views of the German peoples during the French occupation of the states that was exemplified when Austria declared war against France in 1809. 
Austria claimed to act on behalf of all the German states, though there was no support behind their claim. [^1]
Nevertheless, there was a tentative unity through Napoleon’s development of the Confederation of the Rhine. 
Established in 1806, the Confederation started off with seventeen states, adding nineteen more by the year 1810. [^2]
The Confederation’s existence decreased the number of German states from hundreds to thirty-five as they were joined with either the Confederation or the four German states that were not a part of the Confederation. 
This pseudo-unification under French rule led to the adoption of the Napoleonic Code. 
Some states embraced the Code, but there were a number of nationalist groups that despised the idea of living according to the code of their conquerors. [^3] 
These nationalistic ideas became more common after the Franco-Prussian War in 1813, when King Frederick William III of Prussia “whipped up national feelings with a religious fervor” in order to liberate the “nation” and the “fatherland.” [^4] 
Ultimately, the Napoleonic Wars came to an end, culminating in the Congress of Vienna in 1814-1815, but the end of the wars did not mean the end of the hope for unification nor the end of nationalism in the German states.

The end Napoleonic occupation in the German states did not mean that the changes the wars had brought disappeared. 
While the Confederation of the Rhine may have dissolved in 1813, Napoleonic influence did not end there. 
In states annexed by Bavaria or Prussia after the war, they fought tooth and nail to keep the Napoleonic Code, kicking up such a fuss that both states eventually had to give into their demands. [^5]
The Confederation of the Rhine, despite its dissolution, still had influence over the slow unification of the German states, starting with the German Confederation in 1815. [^6]
With members that included the original Confederation of the Rhine as well as the four that were not part of the original Confederation, the German Confederation was a result of the Congress of Vienna and its attempt to return the balance of power to Europe. 
Part of the Congress’s job was to restore prewar boundaries; however, when faced with the multitude of former German states, they created the thirty-nine states of the German Confederation instead. [^7]
The years after the Congress of Vienna found nationalism spreading throughout most of Europe, and the German states were no exception. 
However, while the goal of German nationalism was similar throughout the states, “a Germany unified upon the national principle,” there was no unified nationalistic movement among the states at this time. [^8]
Nevertheless, the rise of nationalism was becoming a concern for rulers such as Klemens von Metternich, who wished to preserve the power of absolute monarchies.

In the aftermath of the Congress of Vienna, nationalism was on the rise throughout Europe and Germans began to call for the unification of the Confederation. 
As German nationalists became more vocal about their wish to unify, Metternich resolutely suppressed any and all resistance. 
He was of the opinion that “the threat of revolution in Germany was a malignant cancer,” and did everything he could to prevent rebellions from erupting in the Confederation. [^9]
Thus, in 1819, he managed to strongarm the Diet of the German Confederation into passing the Karlsbad Decrees. 
These Decrees censored the press, limited freedom of speech, and allowed the German Confederation to become the closest thing to a police state that it could be in the nineteenth century. [^10]
Despite the censorship, people still found ways to get their point across. 
For instance, a political cartoon from 1819 named The *Thinkers Club* critiqued the Decrees. 
Depicting a group of gagged German men sitting around a table, the caption says, “The most important question of today’s meeting: how long will Thinking be allowed to us?” [^11] 
While this is clearly a bleak subject for Germans, this cartoon manages to successfully make its point, clearly hinting at Metternich’s determination to restrict the freedoms of German people without actually naming what it is that the cartoonist is trying to critique. 
Nevertheless, this cartoon exemplifies the way that Germans refused to be stopped by Metternich’s limitations in their quest for freedom while making a clear jab at the Karlsbad Decrees and their extensive restrictions. 
This determination carried over to the attempts at revolutions in the 1830s as well as in 1848. 
While these nationalistically driven events did not succeed in unifying Germany, they managed to set the stage for unification later in the century.

The rise of nationalism during the French occupation of the German states as well as the desire for unification that came out of the Congress of Vienna were instrumental in preparing the German Confederation for the next steps in the process of unifying the German states. 
Nevertheless, there were obstacles such as the Karlsbad Decrees and Metternich’s ruthless suppression of anything that did not support absolute monarchies. 
Despite these challenges, however, German nationalism continued to persevere and so did the wish of many Germans to unify. 
Thus, the Napoleonic Wars and its consequences were able to successfully set the German states on the path to unification later in the nineteenth century.

# Analysis: Austro-Prussian War

The Austro-Prussian War, also known as the "Brother's War," was a pivotal conflict fought from June 14 to July 22, 1866, between Prussia and Austria, two major powers within the German-speaking world. 
Though brief, this war had profound and lasting effects on the political landscape of Germany and Europe, serving as a crucial step towards the unification of Germany under Prussian leadership and reshaping the balance of power in the region.

The roots of the Austro-Prussian War trace back to the intricate and often contentious history of the Holy Roman Empire. [^12] 
Since its formation in the year 800 by Charlemagne the Great, the Holy Roman Empire was a patchwork of German states dominated by the Habsburg dynasty of Austria.[^13] 
From the 1500s onwards, Austria wielded significant power and influence within the German territories. 
However, the rise of Prussia, which began as an electorate in 1618, gradually challenged Austria's dominance. 
By the 18th century, under the leadership of Frederick William I [^14] and his son Frederick II (Frederick the Great), [^15] Prussia had emerged as one of Europe’s foremost military powers, rivaling Austria, Russia, and France. [^16]

The end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815 was significant as the Holy Roman Empire collapsed under Napoleon, leading to the creation of the Confederation of the Rhine. [^17] 
This new confederation fostered a sense of unity among the German states under French control, planting the seeds for German unification. 
Following Napoleon's defeat and the establishment of the German Confederation, the stage was set for the German Question: whether the multitude of German states should unify, and if so, under which power—Austria or Prussia? 
This rivalry intensified as both nations sought to expand their influence and control over the German Confederation, a loose association of 39 German states established by the Congress of Vienna. [^18]

In the decades from 1815 to 1866 leading up to the Austro-Prussian War, Austria and Prussia pursued competing strategies to bolster their power within the Confederation. 
Austria, the traditional leader of the German states, struggled with economic stagnation and political fragmentation. 
Meanwhile, Prussia experienced rapid industrial growth, economic modernization, and substantial military reforms under the leadership of King Wilhelm I [^19] and his ambitious Minister-President, Otto von Bismarck. 
The differing approaches stemmed from Austria's reliance on its historical dominance and large multinational empire, while Prussia focused on modernizing its economy and military to assert its influence.

Recognizing that a confrontation with Austria was inevitable if Prussia was to dominate Germany, Bismarck navigated the diplomatic landscape with skill, working to diplomatically isolate Austria while securing Prussia’s support among other German states. 
His embrace of Realpolitik—an approach focused on practical objectives rather than ideological principles—set the stage for the conflict. 
For example, Bismarck formed strategic alliances with Italy and secured neutrality agreements with Russia and France, effectively isolating Austria.[^20]

One of Bismarck’s earliest and most strategic moves was the occupation of Schleswig-Holstein, two duchies in the Danish realm but with substantial German populations. 
Following the Second Schleswig War with Denmark in 1864, which ended in a German Confederation victory, Prussia and Austria jointly administered these duchies, with Schleswig under Prussian control and Holstein under Austrian control. 
This arrangement, however, quickly became a source of contention, as Bismarck anticipated. 
In 1866, he accused Austria of violating the terms of their agreement by proposing to bring the issue before the German Diet for a resolution. [^21] 
In response, Bismarck moved Prussian troops into Holstein, escalating tensions. 
Austria, in turn, mobilized the forces of the German Confederation against Prussia, igniting the Austro-Prussian War and fracturing the Confederation itself.

Various states, religious factions, cultural ideologies, and families aligned with either Austria or Prussia based on their interests and historical ties.
Austria was supported by Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, Württemberg, Hesse-Kassel, Baden, Hesse-Darmstadt, Nassau, and several smaller German states. 
Prussia, on the other hand, was supported by Saxe-Lauenburg, Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Brunswick, Saxe-Coburg & Gotha, Saxe-Altenburg, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Oldenburg, Anhalt, Schwarzburg, Lippe, Lübeck, Bremen, Hamburg, and Italy. 
Many of the states that sided with Austria were predominantly Catholic, such as Bavaria and Württemberg, while Prussia, being predominantly Protestant, attracted support from other Protestant states. 
Prussia's push for a "Kleindeutschland" (a smaller German state excluding Austria) resonated with states that favored a unified Germany under Prussian leadership, while Austria's vision of a "Grossdeutschland" (a larger German state including Austria) attracted states that preferred a multi-national empire. [^22]

The Habsburg Dynasty led Austria, a powerful and influential family that had ruled over the Holy Roman Empire and the Austrian Empire for centuries. 
Prussia was ruled by the Hohenzollerns, who were keen on expanding their influence and unifying Germany under their leadership. 
Internationally, Italy allied with Prussia as it sought to gain Venetia from Austria. 
Russia remained neutral, with its neutrality secured by Bismarck through diplomatic negotiations. 
France also remained neutral, but Bismarck's diplomacy ensured that France did not intervene on Austria's side.

The Austro-Prussian War was notable for the advanced technology and modern tactics used by the Prussian forces. [^23]
At the war's outset, many of the major German states, such as Bavaria, Saxony, Hanover, and Württemberg, sided with Austria due to their traditional alliances and shared Catholic faith, giving Austria numerical superiority over Prussia. [^24]
However, Prussia’s military advantage lay in its technological innovations, strategic leadership, and new combat tactics.

The Prussian army, commanded by General Helmuth von Moltke, made effective use of railways for rapid troop deployment and wielded the Dreyse needle gun, [^25] a breech-loading rifle that provided a substantial rate-of-fire advantage over the Austrian muzzle-loading rifles. [^26] 
The Prussian army also had a well-organized General Staff, which coordinated their campaigns efficiently. 
These innovations contributed to the decisive Prussian victory at the Battle of Königgrätz on July 3, 1866. 
This battle, located in Bohemia (now the Czech Republic), saw around 285,000 Prussian troops decisively defeat 215,000 Austrian soldiers, resulting in approximately 44,000 Austrian casualties compared to 9,000 Prussian casualties. 
The Prussian artillery and efficient use of railroads were key to this victory. [^27]

Securing a favorable peace, however, presented a challenge for Bismarck. 
Although he sought to neutralize Austria as a rival, he still valued Austria as a potential ally for future endeavors, particularly in case of future conflicts with France or Russia. 
This pragmatism clashed with King Wilhelm I’s view, which favored territorial gains in Austria as a mark of victory. 
The two leaders engaged in a heated debate, with Bismarck at one point threatening to resign if the king did not agree to his vision for peace.
Ultimately, King Wilhelm relented, allowing Bismarck to negotiate a treaty that would reshape German politics without humiliating Austria.

The war formally concluded with the Treaty of Prague on August 23, 1866. [^28] 
The signatories included representatives from both Austria and Prussia. 
The terms of the treaty dissolved the German Confederation and sanctioned the formation of the North German Confederation, led by Prussia, which excluded Austria from German affairs. 
This outcome laid the foundation for Germany’s unification under Prussian leadership. [^29] 
Established in 1867, the North German Confederation included the states north of the Main River and served as a precursor to the German Empire, which would be proclaimed in 1871 following the Franco-Prussian War.

In conclusion, The Austro-Prussian War was a turning point in European history, marking the decline of Austrian influence over the German states and the rise of Prussia as the dominant force in a unified Germany. 
Through this victory, Bismarck not only achieved his vision of German unification but also irrevocably altered the balance of power in Europe. 
The war highlighted the effectiveness of modern military strategies and the importance of technological advancements in warfare.
It also demonstrated Bismarck's strategic brilliance in navigating complex political landscapes and securing favorable outcomes for Prussia.
The implications of the Austro-Prussian War extended beyond German unification, influencing European politics and setting the stage for future conflicts.
The war underscored the shifting alliances and power dynamics that would continue to shape the continent in the years to come.
