# Introduction

## By Lucas Oliveira Melo [Xe/They]

The Unification of Germany was a decades-long process that consumed German imagination throughout the early to mid-19th century, with profound implications for European Geopolitics, before, during, and after. 
Such a process was not a gradual one, however, and is instead characterized by massive advances in short bursts. 
Specifically, this site will show how conflict and political instability were the catalysts for steps towards German unification.

The region now called Germany has long been characterized by disunity since antiquity. [^1]
This briefly changed with the Conquests of Charlemagne which unified German lands under the banner of the Franks. [^2]
Following the dissolution of Francia into Western and Eastern realms, East Francia inherited Charlemagne’s title: “Holy Roman Emperor,” and their realm became the Holy Roman Empire (HRE). [^3]
The unity provided by the HRE was short-lived, as significant feudalization and decentralization transformed Germany; 
once again, disunity characterized Germany. [^4]
An estimate by one historian counts roughly 1800 semi-independent estates at the turn of the 18th century [^5]. [^6]
Once Germany entered the 19th century, the HRE stood no chance against Napoleon.

The HRE died early into the 19th century, [^7] and its death and reorganization was the first phase in the process of unification through conflict.
Although reducing Germany from roughly 300 states to 39 is impressive, [^8] the next major upheaval in 1848 proved to be just as staggering in scale: the Märzrevolutions saw all 39 German states face new, revolutionary challenges, toppled the conservative views of top-down stability, and forced the Germans to reckon with the specter of nationalism and liberalism as driving forces in the latter-half of the century. [^9]
Although its crowning achievement, the Frankfurt Assembly, an attempt at creating a unified German Government, failed spectacularly, [^10] the conservative reckoning brought on by its successes was the step taken. 
Austria’s desire for stable disunity no longer sufficed, and the hyper-conservative yet pragmatic Prussia took advantage.
After two major wars with the Austria and France, a united German Empire with a Prussian Kaiser was declared.

[^5]: The count of Historian John G. Gagliardo is not necessarily accurate, as it counts the rough estimate of landed *knightly* estates. Many were, in fact, semi-independent political polities that had their own militaries, governments, foreign policies, etc. and the number of such polities was often was well within the hundreds. Many, however, were simply landed knightly estates that do not fit standard definitions of independent polities. At its core, the question of how many semi-independent polities within the HRE existed at any given time depends entirely on what one defines as a political polity, and how one defines the cutoff between semi-independent and dependent.Most historians agree that, after the 13th century, answering inquiries on the number of political polities in the HRE with "several hundred" is accurate enough; any additional detail is subject to debate.
