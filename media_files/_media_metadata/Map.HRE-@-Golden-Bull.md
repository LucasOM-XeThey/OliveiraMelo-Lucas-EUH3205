_title: Holy Roman Empire at the Golden Bull of 1356
description: A map of the Holy Roman Empire at the promulgation of the Golden Bull of 1356, which standardized electoral and constitutional processes around Imperial Succession. The Bull was a major step towards polity independence within the HRE, and the map itself demonstrates the disunity within the HRE.
