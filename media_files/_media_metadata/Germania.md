description: This image, the painting Germania, is attributed to Philipp Veit (1793-1877), and is commonly used to represent the March Revolution. It depicts Germany (the nation) as a woman, and celebrates her success in the 1848 revolutions. Originally a wall fresco meant to cover the organ at the Frankfurt am Main church where the Frankfurt Assembly was held, it was transferred to canvas in 1877.
