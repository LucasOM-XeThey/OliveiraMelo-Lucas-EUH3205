description: A Map of the various states of the German Confederation at the outset of the Austro-Prussian War, color-coded for alliances&#58; blue for those aligned with Prussia and red for those aligned with Austria. The map demonstrates how outnumbered Prussia really was during the War, and how impressive its victory was. 

According to its creator, the map was based off map data of the IEG-Maps project (Andreas Kunz, B. Johnen and Joachim Robert Moeschl- University of Mainz) - http://www.ieg-maps.uni-mainz.de
