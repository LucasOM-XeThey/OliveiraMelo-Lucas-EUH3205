_title: Map - Austro-Prussian War
description: <p> A Map of the various states of the German Confederation at the outset of the Austro-Prussian War, color-coded for alliances. The map demonstrates how outnumbered Prussia really was during the War, and how impressive its victory was. It also demonstrates that, although several states did side with Prussia, the largest in the German Confederation sided against them. </p> <p> According to its creator, the map was based off map data of the IEG-Maps project (Andreas Kunz, B. Johnen and Joachim Robert Moeschl- University of Mainz) - http://www.ieg-maps.uni-mainz.de </p>
