_title: The Proclamation of the German Empire in the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles
description: A painting depicting the Proclamation of Wilhelm I of Prussia as the first Kaiser of a unified German Empire. Painted approximately 14 years after the events depicted, the painting is a great demonstration of how Germans in the 1880's saw the proclamation, and continues to be the most famous depiction of the event itself, as it was painted with direct access to people who were at the *Kaiserproklamation* in person allowing for immaculate attention to detail.
