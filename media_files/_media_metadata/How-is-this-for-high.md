_title: How Is This For High?
description: Political Cartoon  by Thomas Nast sketches the crowning of King Wilhelm I of Prussia as Emperor (Kaiser) of Germany, after the unification of the German states into a single nation in 1871.  Nast portrays Otto von Bismarck, the Prussian chancellor, as the (political) artist who has redrawn the map of Germany.  Wilhelm I looks vainly in a mirror, admiring his imperial crown, while his kingly (KÃ¶nig) crown lies in the trash basket.  The mirror is held by King Ludwig II of Bavaria, who joined the Prussian fight against France in July 1870, and that December, at Bismarck's urging, wrote a public letter proposing creation of a unified German empire.
