_title: "Map: The States of the German Empire"
description: A Map showing the various states of the German Empire. Since the proclamation of a unified German Empire was done by peacefully integrating most of the member states of the previous German Confederation and later North German Confederation, most German states prior to the unification retained their monarchs, some autonomy, and their borders (mostly) when joining the Empire. Of the original 39 Member states of the German Confederation, some were annexed directly into Prussia following the Austro-Prussian War, Austria never joined the Empire, and neither did Luxembourg. The rest, plus Alsace-Lorraine, became states within Germany.
