# Credits and Acknowledgments

## Lucas OM's Credits

I would like to credit and acknowledge my dad for his help in finding and fixing minor bugs, as well as for finding me a "Basic Syntax Markdown Guide," and for supporting me as webmaster. 
Find the guide my dad gave me here: [Basic Syntax | Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/). Not all of it applied to this website, nor did it all work, but most of its tips did!

I would also like to credit my groupmates for working with me in placing their work in a manner that made it relatively simple to input into the website, and for allowing me to bug them about what pronouns they prefer and allowing me to input those pronouns into our presentation and our website. 

I would like to extend gratitude to Prof. Goodwin for being so helpful in finding solutions to weird bugs, and for putting up with my questions and yapping.
